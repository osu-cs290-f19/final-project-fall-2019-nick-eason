  "review": "Breaking Bad fanatics were shocked when this movie sequel came to Netflix. It caught many by pleasant surprise and deserved all the hype that it received. The movie centers around Jesse Pinkman and the fallout of the climax of the Breaking Bad series. I won't spoil anything as this movie would be nothing without its predecessor, so if you want watch this movie, I suggest you spend the necessary 62 hours to watch the complete Breaking Bad series. You will not regret it."
